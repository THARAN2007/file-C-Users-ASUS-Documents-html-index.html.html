<B><p><h2><em><font face="Britannic Bold"color="navy">BIRDS live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about 10000 living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.</b>
<b>Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture.Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators.
Birds are feathered theropod style-dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs.
<p style="color:red;">Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. 
Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.</h2></font></em>
